Hacky hack

In simple terms, Hacking is a process of getting illegal access to a device that may include a mobile phone, computer, networks, social media accounts, or other authorized accounts. For example, hacking the password of a computer and gaining access to it. Although it is an illegal process, it is not always performed for bad deeds. The person who does hacking is known as a Hacker. These people have complete or even depth knowledge about the devices. Therefore, if a device is not strongly secured, it becomes easy for hackers to break the security and enter the device and hack it. A Hacker is responsible for finding the weakness of a computer and gaining access over the system. There are different types of hackers where some are known as official hackers as they perform the illegal process for accomplishing a legal task. On the other hand, there are unofficial hackers who, with no official goal, hack a device illegally. Thus, hacking a computer or other device illegally is a crime for which the hacker can be arrested in an unlawful activity approach.
